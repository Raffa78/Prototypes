Thanks for purchasing ParrotTester!

The documentation can be found at: http://www.voidupdate.com/parrottester/doc/

You may get an unhandled exception when you first import ParrotTester. 
To fix, go to Build Settings -> Player Settings and make sure Api Compatibility Level (under Optimization) is set to .NET 2.0. 
By default, it will be .NET 2.0 Subset.
